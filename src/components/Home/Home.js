              I am a software engineering student at Graphic Era Hill University in Dehradun, India. 
              Set to graduate in 2025, I have already established myself as a promising full-stack developer with a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies.
              Currently maintaining an impressive CGPA of 7.7, my academic excellence is matched by my practical skills and project experience. 
              My technical repertoire includes proficiency in languages such as C/C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python, as well as expertise in popular frameworks like React and Node.js.
              My passion for web development extends beyond just coding. 
              I have a keen eye for user experience and responsive design, implementing these principles using modern CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS. 
              On the back-end, i've worked in SQL and PostgreSQL databases.
